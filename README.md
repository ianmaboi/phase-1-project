## Introduction

News API is a powerful and easy-to-use API that provides access to a wide range of news articles and headlines from various sources around the world. Whether you are building a news aggregator, a content recommendation system, or simply need access to the latest news, News API has you covered.

This README will guide you through the process of getting started with News API, making requests, and understanding the response format.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using News API, you will need the following:

- **API Key**: You must obtain an API key by signing up on the [News API website](https://www.example.com/news-api-signup).

### Installation

There's no need to install any libraries or SDKs to use News API. You can make HTTP requests directly to our API endpoints using your preferred programming language.

## Usage

### Authentication

To authenticate with News API, include your API key as a query parameter in your requests:

```
https://newsapi.org/v2/endpoint?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Making Requests

You can make HTTP GET requests to the News API endpoints to retrieve news data. Replace `endpoint` with the specific endpoint you want to access. See the [Endpoints](#endpoints) section for available endpoints.

### Response Format

News API returns data in JSON format. Each response includes key information such as articles, sources, and more. For detailed information about the response format, refer to our [API documentation](https://www.example.com/news-api-docs).

## Endpoints

News API provides the following endpoints:

### 1. Top Headlines

Get the top headlines from various news sources.

Endpoint: `/v2/top-headlines`

### 2. Everything

Search for articles from a variety of sources based on your criteria.

Endpoint: `/v2/everything`

### 3. Sources

Retrieve a list of available news sources and their details.

Endpoint: `/v2/sources`

For detailed information about each endpoint and their parameters, refer to our [API documentation](https://www.example.com/news-api-docs).

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use News API in different programming languages:

### Python

```python
import requests

api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
url = f'https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?apiKey={api_key}&country=us'

response = requests.get(url)
data = response.json()

# Process the data here
```

### JavaScript (Node.js)

```javascript
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
const url = `https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?apiKey=${apiKey}&country=us`;

fetch(url)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // Process the data here
  });
```

## Error Handling

News API returns standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. If there is an error, you will receive an error response with details about the issue. Be sure to handle errors gracefully in your application.
